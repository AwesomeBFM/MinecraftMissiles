- Missile Control Pad: [Missile Control Pad](https://i.imgur.com/0Z7ZQ9M.png) 
#### Instructions:
1. place down the missile silo.
2. right-click the missile silo with a missile control pad.
3. load missiles into the open slot. It should be noted that missiles are on a control pad by control pad basis,
meaning that if you use the same control pad with a different silo it will have the same missiles. Similarly, if you were
to use a different tablet with the same silo, you will not have missiles.
4. Once you have missiles loaded, selected your targets. The HIFI targeting system will automatically find the 3 closest
targets. HIFI scanners will only be able to lock onto the three closest players so chose you missile silo locations
wisely. You can select mutliple targets by clicking on their heads, to deselect a target, click on their head again.
5. With the targets selected, click launch. The missiles will be launched and will hit the targets. You will need
enough missiles to be able to launch.

## Missiles
There are 2 different types of missiles, each with different computers and payloads. <br/>
- Mark I: 
  - The Mark I missile has an Info j7 processor and 1 lbs of payload. The payload will strike the target and damage 
what is around them, but likely not be enough to kill them. While the Info j7 is not the most powerful computer, it
will lock on and hit it's target  .
- Joe V:
  - The Joe V is for the ultimate attack. Equipped with a RMD Rise 9 and 10 lbs of payload, the Joe V is the most
aggressive missile in the arsenal. The payload will decimate the surrounding area and likely kill the target. The RMD Rise
9 will surpass every jammer, guaranteeing a hit everytime.
